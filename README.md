ArvinCord is a FlameCord modification to add essential features such as commands, whitelist system, etc.

ArvinCord is compiled like FlameCord does. If you need help, you can always create an [Issue](../../issues) in this repository.

## Why fork FlameCord?
ArvinCord forked out of desire for greater configurability to give to BungeeCord based proxies, which FlameCord is currently unable to offer.

ArvinCord will track upstream FlameCord and merge changes as needed.

## How To (Server Admins)
Download a copy of ArvinCord.jar from releases tab [here](../../releases).

ArvinCord requires **Java 8** or above.

## How To (Compiling from source)
To compile FlameCord, you need JDK8 or above, git, bash, maven, and an internet connection.

Clone this repo, run `./arvincord b` from *bash*, get jar from `ArvinCord-Proxy/bootstrap/target`
